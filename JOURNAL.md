Title - " DEV ROVER "
Author - Anirudh Sahu
description - "Dev rover is a physical rover which is smart enough to provide informations set by the developer like the weather, time, updates, alrams, and it could also move on its wheel and use a servo motor to pick up things and move them

June 11th: researched around the topic and created a rough schematic and PCB
3 PM IST - 6:20 PM IST
Initially I started with creating a rough plan of what exactly to include in my project.
As its a smart rover ill need a few dc motor a couple of servo motors and a mini computer to make it smart.
So as this is my starting project I didnt really knew how to get started with the PCB designing. i used Easy EDA but still when I seareched for components There were wayy tooo many options so I was overwhelmed and confused then I selected a esp32 and a L298N I have a knowledge of physical components just the firmware is new then I made the intial connections with the esp32 but later I found that the ESP32 I was using didnt had a 5V power supply so I had to restart and find a new one which took a bit time and also I had to understand why this happened. next I created a rough pcb and a 3d view of it I'm now planning to try some other alternatives for the designing part.

June 12th: Started with designing the case
6 pm ist to 10 pm ist
These were one of the worst hours in my journey. I started with the recommendations from others to use onshape but when I actually started I had a really hard time. first the models I imported had 300 parts so to move it to the center I had to select all which made my computer burst lol ( not literally ) then I learned about onshape it had very less tutorials also so still I managed but then again it started to lag too much. I literally couldnt think of anything else then I asked in slack so I'll start my journey with most probable fusion360 from tommorow. Todays day made me learn many things and I also have models of esp32, servo motor, dc motor, l298 motor Driver
