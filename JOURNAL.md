June 6th: researched around the topic and created a rough schematic and PCB
3 PM IST - 6:20 PM IST
Initially I started with creating a rough plan of what exactly to include in my project.
As its a smart rover ill need a few dc motor a couple of servo motors and a mini computer to make it smart.
So as this is my starting project I didnt really knew how to get started with the PCB designing. i used Easy EDA but still when I seareched for components There were wayy tooo many options so I was overwhelmed and confused then I selected a esp32 and a L298N I have a knowledge of physical components just the firmware is new then I made the intial connections with the esp32 but later I found that the ESP32 I was using didnt had a 5V power supply so I had to restart and find a new one which took a bit time and also I had to understand why this happened. next I created a rough pcb and a 3d view of it I'm now planning to try some other alternatives for the designing part.
